# Final Project - Sudoku 
--- 

Welcome to my final project for my programming fundamentals class at UFC. 
The project consists of a python implementation of the game called Sudoku, 
which the objective is to complete a 9x9 grid with numbers between 1 and 9
without repeating a number in a column, line, and within a 3x3 square.
